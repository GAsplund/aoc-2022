# Advent of Code 2022
This is my personal repository with my attempts for AoC 2022.
This year I will be doing the polyglot challenge, which means that I will be doing each day in different languages.
I will also be documenting extraordinary or noteworthy solutions I come across, which may be seen below if I happen to come across them.
